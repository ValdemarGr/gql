title: Error handling
---
There different types of errors in gql.

* Schema validation errors, which should be caught in development.
These are for instance caused by duplicate field names or invalid typenames.
* Query preparation errors, which are errors caused by invalid queries.
* Execuion errors. These are errors that occur during query evaluation, caused by user-supplied functions.

## Execution
Error handling in gql can be performed in two ways, it can be returned explicitly or raised in `F`.
For instance, the `EffectResolver[F, I, A]` wraps the function `I => F[Ior[String, A]]`.
